# Power_Task2_HBridge

In this circuit I used **L293D, Two motors, Arduino, Board, Power supply, wiers**. 

The task of the circuit is to control the direction and speed of rotation of the motors.

I connected the Board to the **"Power and the Ground"** on the Power supply, then I connected the **L293D** pins
( **power1, power2, and 4grounds** ) with **Power and Ground** by the Board, then I connected the rest of the pins to the corresponding **Digital pins on the Arduino**.

Finally, I connected the motors with the **L293D** via pins (**output1, output2, output3, output4**).
